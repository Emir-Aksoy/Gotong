// workflows by talking to it in plain language. Duck-typed so the web layer
// takes NO runtime dep on `@gotong/hub-steward` (mirroring InboxSurface /
// MeWorkflowEditSurface); the host's `HubStewardSurface` satisfies it.
//
//   - `plan`  turns one instruction into a classified proposal with ZERO side
//             effects — the member previews it, then applies the actions they
//             accept;
//   - `apply` executes ONE accepted action. The action rides as `unknown`: the
//             HOST surface is the validation + classification authority
//             (`validateStewardAction` + re-tiering), so web forwards it
//             verbatim and never trusts the client's tier. Dangerous / cross-hub
