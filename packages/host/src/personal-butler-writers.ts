/**
 * personal-butler-writers.ts — turn a patch-capable memory handle into the three
 * INJECTED meta writers the long-term memory engine needs (Z-M2).
 *
 * The memory enhancements that AMEND an established entry's meta — closing a
 * bitemporal validity interval (D), reinforcing a recalled fact (F), growing an
 * associative link set (E) — are leaf-package primitives that compute the new
 * meta but deliberately DON'T touch the filesystem. Each hands its result to an
 * injected writer (`MemoryValidityWriter` / `MemoryReinforcer` / `MemoryLinkWriter`),
 * so `@aipehub/personal-memory` stays framework-friendly (no I/O) and the host
 * decides how to persist. This module is that host decision: wire all three to
 * the file backend's in-place `patchMeta` (Z-M1).
 *
 * The actual meta TRANSFORM stays in the leaf package (`closedMeta`,
 * `reinforcedMeta`, `META_LINKS`) — one source of truth for which keys mean
 * what, no drift between "how the budget reads validTo" and "how the host
 * stamps it". This adapter only routes the computed patch to `patchMeta`, which
 * shallow-merges it (so a `{ validTo }` delta never clobbers `validFrom` /
 * `links` / `importance`).
 *
 * Default OFF: nothing calls these unless a reviewer / recall path is wired with
 * them (the example does so in Z-M4). With no writer the leaf behavior is
 * byte-identical to pre-enhancement.
