/**
 * `MemoryRetriever` — a swappable backend for the on-demand `recall` path.
 *
 * The butler's memory has two retrieval surfaces with very different needs:
 *
 *   - The **frozen block** (system-prompt prefix) is the curated `semantic`
 *     profile. It MUST stay byte-stable across a session (prompt-cache), so it
 *     is NOT pluggable — it always reads the handle's curated semantic memory.
 *   - The **`recall` tool** is the on-demand path the model uses mid-turn to dig
 *     up older detail. THIS is where a smarter retriever pays off: vector
 *     search, hybrid rerank, a chroma-mcp index — anything that ranks better
 *     than the file backend's substring match.
 *
 * So the retriever seam sits ONLY on `recall`. Writes (`remember` / `forget`)
 * always go to the `MemoryHandle`; the retriever just answers queries. Default
 * is the handle's own `recall` (substring) — a host swaps in a vector retriever
 * without replacing the whole handle.
 *
 * Note: composing a chroma-mcp `McpToolset` as a benign tool is the OTHER way to
 * give the butler RAG. The two compose — the retriever upgrades the built-in
 * `recall` tool in place; an MCP tool adds a separate, explicitly-named search.

/**
 * The Chinese-aware lexical retriever — the new DEFAULT for the `recall` tool.
 *
 * It pulls a recency window WITHOUT handing `text` to the backend (so the
 * backend's substring filter can't pre-drop a non-contiguous CJK match), then
 * ranks every candidate by {@link relevanceScore} (CJK bigram / Latin token
 * overlap), breaking ties by importance-then-recency. It is a strict improvement
 * over substring matching:
 *
 *   - a full-phrase hit still scores 1, Latin tokens still match, an empty query
 *     still returns importance-then-recency (identical to {@link handleRetriever});
 *   - but 「奶茶店」 now finds 「卖奶茶的店」 where the substring backend returned
 *     nothing.
 *
 * With a query present, zero-relevance candidates are dropped (the tool still
 * NARROWS, as a keyword search should). Scope: it ranks over the most recent
 * `wideK` (cap 200) — for a consolidated, budget-bounded butler that is
 * effectively the whole store; an injected vector retriever (C-M3) handles
 * unbounded corpora.
